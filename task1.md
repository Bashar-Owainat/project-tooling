## 1.1 
1.	Select a real business-related problem and investigate it by generating and highlighting a well-defined problem definition statement. You need to identify the issues to be addressed along with possible solutions supported by a combination of user and system requirements. 


- Here in Jordan, we don't have a lot of web pages to order food online so we decided to create
a web page that gathers restaurants in one place to make the process of ordering food easier.
User and system requirements
1.	There is a div for each restaurant category in the home page.
2.	Once the user clicks on the image of their favourite restaurant it opens the page for that restaurant.
3.	The user can find the menu in each restaurant page.
4.	The shopping cart can be checked by the user.
5.	 The user can see the total of all meals

## 1.2
2. Since the success of each project is often associated with many risks, you need to identify areas of risk related to the successful completion of your application
Risks
- bad scheduling
- not to meet stakeholder's expectations 
-bad code quality
- bad communication between team members

## 1.3
3-Examine the business-related problem and create a well-structured Software Design that analyses the proposed solution by including relevant details about the following: 

•	List of requirements


Requirements  
- Home page should contain a link for each restaurant  
- There should be a menu in each restaurant  
- The system should have the ability to show the items the user order the their total





•	Database design and the wireframe
In our system there is a constructor that takes both meal’s name and price then it pushes it to an array and then saves it to the local Storage.
## note:the images are saved in the files

•	Testing technique
(Black box testing)

Black Box Testing is a software testing method that involves testing the functions of software applications without knowing the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal routes. Black Box Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the input and output of software applications and is totally driven by software requirements and specifications. Behavioral testing is another name for it.
