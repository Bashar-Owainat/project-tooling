1.	To produce a high-quality software, you need to conduct a study on the use of various software development tools and techniques, and then select your preferred tool and techniques to develop your project. 

You can search, compare and choose from the following tools to work on your project:

	

| Category  |      Tool     |       |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| IDE                      |  Visual Studio Code  | PyCharm |
| Operating System         |    Linux |   Windows|
| Version-control platform | GitHub|  GitLab |



| windows   |     Linux     |  
|----------|:-------------:|
| Windows is a Microsoft-developed and-published graphical OS that allows you to store files, run software, play games, watch videos, and access the Internet. |  Linux is an operating system or kernel that's freely available under an open-source license. Its core functionality is very similar to that of UNIX. | 
| Windows 4 types of users administrator, standard, child and guest |    Linux 3 types of users regular, administrative, service users  |   
| windows  is commercial, it is usually priced between $100 and 200$ USD. | Linux is an open source, the majority of distributions are free and open source. Although companies charge for maintenance for their distributions, the underlying software is still available for download and installation. |    


| Visual Studio Code   |      PyCharm      |  
|----------|:-------------:|
| Visual Studio Code: is a streamlined code editor that helps you with development operation including debugging, task execution running, and version control.|  PyCharm is a Python IDE that includes a wide range of necessary tools for Python developers that are tightly integrated to create a convenient environment for productive Python, web, and data science development. |
| Faster than PyCharm |    Slower than VS code   | 
| Consumes less memory |Consumes more memory |   
|  It has an extension for almost everything      | 3000 extensions|
|    Easier to use    |    Has features that most people don’t use regularly (harder to use)    |
|   Free and open-source  |      Around $200 a year    |



| GitLab    |     GitHub     |  
|----------|:-------------:| 
| It puts more emphasis on offering a features-based system with an integrated, centralized platform for web developers. |  It puts more emphasis on infrastructure performance.|  
| is better for projects that require continuous integration |    Is better for large projects with a lot of developers    |   
| it has a small community | it has a large community|

2.	Once you have reviewed, you need to provide a comprehensive explanation of the reasons for choosing the tools and techniques you have chosen to develop your application.


I chose **VS code** for many reasons. VS is a really fast streamlined code editor, it is easy to use, Open source, it doesn’t consume a lot of memory and it has a huge number of extensions. VS code is very good when it comes to day-to-day use because it helps the user to be productive by providing syntax highlighting, box-selection and bracket-matching.

Regarding **Linux** I chose it for the following reasons:
-Linux provides high level of security so you can avoid viruses easily.
-Linux is not vulnerable to crashes (High stability).
-It is an open source 
-To use its command line

A for **GitHub** I chose it because it’s a very large community that allows to contributes on open-source projects, it’s base on git which means it allows multiple developers to work on same project without causing a mess. Also, it helps the user to get great documentation and it allows you to use MarkDown language.
